            <p class="justify-content-lg-center align-items-center text-center px-4 py-1">Currently, I have over 4 years of professional experience as a software engineer in banking SaaS. I am a Full Stack developer working with internal and external Tools applications. In our primary app, I utilize Ruby/Ruby on Rails for back-end services in tandem with JavaScript, React and TypeScript for the front-end. In another app, I use NodeJS for back-end along with React/JS on the front-end. Previously, I worked for 2 years to help create, maintain and update back-end microservices built with NodeJS and JavaScript for Fintech companies. For the last year, I have also been serving as Scrum Master to feature teams in addition to my SE duties. This has helped me to understand the interaction between product and engineering on a much deeper level. In those duties, I facilitate scrum activities, help drive PI planning epics, lead discussions, improve processes and work cross-functionally to unblock impediments/reduce risk and help deliver on commitments. I am especially proud of my ability to work independently or collaboratively as part of a team and I am an excellent communicator. My primary focus is to become an excellent all-around software engineer and leader.
            </p>
            <p>I also have strong aspirations to work in the future as a Sales/Solutions/Implementations Engineer where I can mesh my love for software engineering with my people skills to provide value, solve complex problems and help support amazing software products. I believe that my skills and strengths align perfectly with this type of role. Have a chat with me sometime and you'll see why.

            <hr className='col-4'></hr>
            <p>As a software engineer: I am a quick study, I have a voracious appetite for learning, a positive and tenacious attitude and I have an investigative mindset with a willingness to get my hands dirty digging into complex issues. I am excellent at writing documentation and taking diligent notes, I have experience in at least 2 programming languages, I am comfortable working back-end or front-end (my preference) and I work great independently and as part of a team. My people and soft skills are top notch from working over 10 years in sales and account management prior to becoming a software engineer. These skills include: strong interpersonal skills, high emotional intelligence, leadership, decision-making, tailored product demonstrations, high touch sales experience, discovery, problem-solving, account management (from mom-and-pop to large chains like Whole Foods), prospecting, qualifying, and of course, closing. </p>
            <p>I have a passion for art and it will always be a creative outlet for me. As a result of that, I also have proficiency in graphic design with over 15 years of experience with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. I love to create works in printed media, digital media, logo design and branding.</p>

              I strive to learn something new every day. I have an achievement personality and a growth mindset. I am always working to improve my skills, setting new goals and challenging myself to meet and exceed them.

              My favorite motto is "you miss 100% of the shots that you don't take". I try new things and fail. But like Spiderman, no matter how many hits I take, I always find a way to get back up. I am a proud girl dad, a dog dad, a husband, a tech nerd, a home brewer, an artist and a true soccer fanatic.
