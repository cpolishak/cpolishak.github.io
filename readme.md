Welcome to my personal website! It is built using Javascript, NodeJS, React and Bootstrap. Feel free to check it out and connect with me on LinkedIn or Github.

## Notes

This website serves a base portfolio page promoting my skills as a software engineer. It is subject to periodic changes as I also use it as a playground for testing out new technologies, tricks and code.
