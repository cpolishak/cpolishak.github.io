# Welcome to my portfolio website!

I created this site from the ground up using bootstrap, html, css as well as javascript and hosted it on Github. It will serve as my digital portfolio for Full Stack Development as a quick reference to see some of the things that I can do, am working on and to showcase some of my personal artwork and digital media. To see my site go to https://cpolishak.github.io/  or just click [here](https://cpolishak.github.io/ )

## 

In the future I will be creating my own personal website with my own chosen hosting, unique domain and such. But for now this will do and it's a fun way to learn more real world applications for what I am learning in bootcamp and teaching myself out of self interest.
